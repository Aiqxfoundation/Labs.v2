## üìã Pre-Deployment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following (optional for enhanced features):

```env
# IPFS Configuration (Optional - for token logos)
VITE_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
VITE_PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key

# Blockchain RPC Configuration (Optional - for enhanced RPC endpoints)
VITE_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
VITE_ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
VITE_BSC_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
VITE_POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# Application Settings
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

### Service Setup (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Pinata IPFS** (for token logos):
   - Sign up at https://pinata.cloud
   - Generate API keys
   - Add to `.env` file
   - Enables: Logo uploads, metadata storage

2. **Alchemy** (for enhanced RPC):
   - Sign up at https://alchemy.com
   - Create apps for Ethereum, Polygon
   - Add API keys to `.env`
   - Enables: Faster RPC, better reliability

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Test on testnets:
# - Ethereum Sepolia
# - BSC Testnet
# - Solana Devnet

# Verify:
# ‚úÖ Token creation works on all chains
# ‚úÖ Wallet connections work
# ‚úÖ All management tools function
# ‚úÖ Transactions confirm successfully
```

### 2. Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm run preview
```

### 3. Deploy to Replit

```bash
# Click "Deploy" button in Replit
# Or use Replit CLI
replit deploy
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Test mainnet token creation (small test amount)
- [ ] Verify all wallet connections
- [ ] Check transaction tracking
- [ ] Test all token management features
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Check all navigation links
- [ ] Test help documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Coming Soon Features

1. **Solana Metadata Update** (client/src/utils/solanaTools.ts)
   - Status: Placeholder implemented
   - Reason: Requires Metaplex browser compatibility updates
   - Timeline: Next release

2. **Solana Authority Revocation from Manage Page** (client/src/pages/manage-authorities.tsx)
   - Status: Placeholder implemented  
   - Note: Individual revoke pages work perfectly
   - Workaround: Use dedicated revoke pages in Solana tools menu
   - Timeline: Next release

3. **EVM Multisender Implementation** (client/src/pages/tools-evm.tsx)
   - Status: UI ready, implementation pending
   - Note: Basic transfer functionality works
   - Timeline: Next release

### These are NON-BLOCKING
All core token creation and management features are fully functional. These are enhancement features that don't affect primary platform functionality.
